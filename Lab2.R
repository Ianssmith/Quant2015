6. Show summary statistics and an appropriate graph for Birth Weight in Grams.

summary(lowbwt$BWT)

Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 
709 2414 2977 2945 3475 4990


7. Describe the distribution of Birth Weight in Grams.

summary(lowbwt$BWT)
The distribution appears to be a little negatively skewed, as shown by the mean being smaller than the median.
However the numerical midway point between the max and min is about 2100 which is significantly smaller than 
the median of the data this dissonance shows that for low birthweight births tend to be either significantly low
or normal but infrequently somewhere in between.

8. Show a crosstab of Low Birth Weight BY Smoking Status During Pregnancy.

prop.table(table(lowbwt$LOW, lowbwt$SMOKE), 2)

FALSE TRUE
FALSE 0.7478261 0.5945946
TRUE 0.2521739 0.4054054

9. Does there appear to be a relationship between Low Birth Weight and Smoking Status During Pregnancy? Explain.

summary(lowbwt$SMOKE)
pie(table(lowbwt$SMOKE))
freqtable(lowbwt$SMOKE)
prop.table(table(lowbwt$LOW, lowbwt$SMOKE), 2)

There does appear to be a relationship. All else being equal if you are not smoking the chances af having a low birthweight are about 25%, however if you are smoking the percentage of low birthweight births increases to about 41%
